# Smart-IDS
 A Smart Intrusion Detection System (SmartIDS) uses AI and machine learning to detect and respond to network threats in real-time, identifying novel and sophisticated attacks through behavior and anomaly analysis.



# Explanation of the Code
This script is designed to create an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) using a Random Forest classifier. The script performs the following steps:

# Logging Setup:

Initializes logging to record important events and alerts.

# Data Loading:

Loads the training and testing datasets from CSV files.

# Data Preprocessing:

Encodes categorical features (e.g., protocol_type, service, flag) using LabelEncoder.
Splits the datasets into features (X_train, X_test) and labels (y_train, y_test).
Normalizes numerical features (duration, src_bytes, dst_bytes) using StandardScaler.

# Feature Selection:

Trains a Random Forest model to determine feature importances.
Selects the top 20 most important features.

# Model Training:

Trains a new Random Forest model using the selected features.
Evaluates the model using a confusion matrix and classification report.

# Model Saving:

Saves the trained model to disk using joblib.

# Real-Time Monitoring:

Defines functions to simulate data collection, preprocess new data, and alert administrators.
Continuously monitors network data, makes predictions, and logs alerts for malicious activity.

# How to Use the Code

Prepare Your Environment:

Ensure you have the required libraries installed:  pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
Make sure your training and testing datasets (KDDTrain.csv and KDDTest.csv) are located at the specified paths.

Modify Paths:

If your datasets are located elsewhere, update the paths in the script:  train_data = pd.read_csv("path/to/KDDTrain.csv")
                                                                                                                 test_data = pd.read_csv("path/to/KDDTest.csv")

Run the Script:

Execute the script in your Python environment. The script will:
Load and preprocess the data.
Train the model and evaluate its performance.
Save the trained model to smartids_model.pkl.
Monitor in Real-Time:

The script enters a continuous loop to monitor network data. It will:
Simulate real-time data collection.
Preprocess the new data.
Predict whether the new data is normal or malicious.
Log an alert if malicious activity is detected.
Detailed Breakdown of Functions
get_new_network_data():

Simulates real-time data collection by sampling a row from the test set.
In a real-world scenario, replace this with actual data collection logic.
preprocess_data(new_data):

Preprocesses the new data to ensure it is in the same format as the training data.
Retains only the selected features.
alert_admin():

Logs an alert message indicating malicious activity detection.
monitor_network():

Continuously monitors network data.
Collects new data, preprocesses it, and makes a prediction.
Logs an alert if the prediction indicates malicious activity.
Adjust the sleep time (time.sleep(1)) as needed to control the frequency of data collection.
Example Usage
Here's an example of how to use the script:

Save the script to a file, e.g., smartids.py.

Run the script in your terminal or Python environment:  python smartids.py

Check the log file smartids.log for alerts and other logged information.

# Real-World Considerations:

>Data Collection: Replace the simulated data collection in get_new_network_data with actual network traffic data.
>Feature Engineering: Ensure that the features used in training reflect the actual features present in the real-time data.
>Performance Tuning: Optimize the model and preprocessing steps for better performance based on your specific dataset and requirements.
>Security: Run the script in a secure environment to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data privacy.
